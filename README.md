# Meet^ for Android

## Setup

Setup doesn't require that you have Cocopods installed, luckily.

Setup is pretty simple. Clone the repo, don't install the dependencies via Cocoapods, open the folder in Android Studio, and build/run.

You will also need to create the file keys.xml in Meet-Android/app/src/main/res/values, and create strings for the values "server_api_key" and "facebook_app_id".

```
$ git clone git@github.com:molmsted98/Meet-Android.git
```
